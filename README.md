# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose
We were asked to complete a full analysis of the school district. After performing this analysis, the school board found evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically finding altered reading and math scores among the ninth graders at Thomas High School. We were asked to replace the scores for all of the ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaN and repeat the analysis. 

## Initial Results
### Summary Based on Type
From the district summary below, we can see that the Charter Schools tended to have higher scores and passing percentages over the District Schools.

### Summary Based on Size
Looking at the results based on the size of the school, we can see that the schools with fewer students, less than 2,000, had much higher scores and passing percentages overall.

### Summary Based on Spending
Interesting to note that the spending ranges per student demonstrated an inverse relationship between spending and passing percentage.

## Final Results and Comparisons
After removing the reading and math scores for the ninth graders at Thomas High School, we repeated the district analysis and found the overall results relatively unchanged for both the district and Thomas High School.
